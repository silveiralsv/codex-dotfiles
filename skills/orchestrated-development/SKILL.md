description: Orchestrate non-trivial repository development through parent-led investigation and planning, implementation by luna_max_implementer, parent review and acceptance, and pull-request publication by luna_pr_writer. Use for features, substantial fixes, maintenance, refactors, and tests. Do not use for read-only analysis, diagnosis without requested fixes, or tiny mechanical changes.

# Orchestrated Development

Run non-trivial development work with the primary agent as orchestrator,
architectural owner, reviewer, and final approver.

## Roles

The primary agent owns project-state interpretation, ticket selection,
investigation, architecture, implementation planning, risk analysis, review of
the actual diff, and final acceptance.

Custom agents are:

- `luna_max_implementer`: the only write-heavy implementation and fix worker.
- `luna_pr_writer`: the final branch, commit, push, and pull-request worker.

Do not create a reviewer subagent. Architectural review remains with the
primary agent.

## Completion boundary

For substantial development requests, branch creation, commit, push, and
pull-request creation are part of completion unless the user requests
local-only work, says not to create a pull request, repository instructions
prohibit it, or authentication, permissions, or external state block
publication.

Never merge automatically.

For a very small or mechanical change, the primary agent may work directly
when delegation would cost substantially more than the change. It must still
inspect the diff and run proportionate validation.

## Workflow

### 1. Establish the baseline

Before changing anything:

- Read every applicable `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
- Inspect the current branch, Git status, existing diff, recent commits,
  remotes, and relevant open pull requests when available.
- Record pre-existing or unrelated changes so they are not confused with
  worker output.
- Use the repository's existing ticket, roadmap, planning, or project-state
  mechanism.
- Resume existing in-progress work before selecting later work.
- Use a user-supplied ticket or task directly.
- When no task was supplied, select work only from clear repository evidence.
  Ask the user when the choice would materially change scope.

### 2. Investigate

Perform proportionate investigation of the affected architecture, ownership,
existing patterns, reusable code, callers, dependencies, data flow, tests,
integration boundaries, failure modes, and edge cases. Consider security,
authorization, data integrity, compatibility, concurrency, and performance
when relevant.

Keep investigation focused and reuse context already established in the task.

### 3. Approve an implementation plan

Before delegation, produce a concrete plan containing what is relevant:

- desired outcome and acceptance criteria;
- files or systems likely affected;
- required behavior and ownership boundaries;
- API, state, data, protocol, or interface changes;
- architectural and compatibility constraints;
- edge cases and failure handling;
- expected tests and validation commands;
- known pre-existing worktree changes;
- explicit exclusions.

The primary agent owns all architectural decisions. Give the worker enough
context to implement without repeating broad investigation.

### 4. Delegate implementation

Spawn the custom agent named exactly `luna_max_implementer`. Provide the task
or ticket identifier, approved plan, acceptance criteria, relevant
architectural context, baseline worktree state, excluded scope, and validation
expectations.

Do not override its configured model or reasoning effort. Only one write-heavy
agent may work on the task at a time. Do not spawn competing implementers or
parallel writers.

Keep its thread available for review corrections. Wait for implementation and
validation to finish before reviewing.

### 5. Review the actual diff

The primary agent must inspect Git status and the complete resulting diff
against the recorded baseline. Never accept implementation solely from the
worker summary or because tests pass.

Review correctness, requirements coverage, architecture, ownership,
unnecessary complexity, regressions, assumptions, edge cases, failure
handling, compatibility, test quality, maintainability, security,
authorization, concurrency, migrations, destructive behavior, performance,
and unrelated changes when relevant.

Use Ponytail guidance when available to identify code that can be deleted,
reused, or replaced by existing or native functionality. Its absence must not
block the workflow.

### 6. Correct substantive findings

Send precise corrective instructions to the same `luna_max_implementer`
thread. Include the affected behavior or location, why it is incorrect, the
expected correction, and validation that must be rerun.

Do not spawn a replacement implementer. Avoid correction loops for cosmetic
preferences handled by formatters or linters.

The primary agent may directly fix a tiny mechanical issue when clearly more
efficient. Architecture-sensitive corrections return to the implementer.

### 7. Perform final acceptance

Confirm requirements and acceptance criteria, architectural consistency,
scope, tests, highest-signal checks, and error handling. Confirm applicable
security, authorization, integrity, compatibility, concurrency, migration,
and performance concerns are resolved.

Run lint, type checks, builds, smoke tests, schema validation, or integration
checks when relevant. Update repository planning state and acceptance evidence
only when the task is genuinely complete.

### 8. Publish the pull request

After final acceptance, spawn the custom agent named exactly
`luna_pr_writer`. Provide the approved file scope, ticket or task identifier,
implementation summary, validation results, architectural decisions worth
recording, intended base branch, and known limitations or follow-ups.

Ensure no other write-heavy agent is active. The PR worker may create the
branch, commit, push, and open the pull request using repository conventions
and `gh` when available.

If Caveman Commit is available, it may produce the commit message. Its absence
must not block publication.

If the PR worker finds a substantive problem, return control to the primary
agent. The PR worker must not redesign or hide failing validation.

Never merge, force-push, rewrite unrelated history, discard unrelated changes,
or use destructive Git operations.

## Parent-owned decisions

The primary agent retains ownership of major architecture, authentication,
authorization, trust boundaries, financial logic, risky migrations,
concurrency, distributed behavior, caching consistency, queues, events,
external integrations, public contracts, backward compatibility,
performance-sensitive systems, infrastructure, deployment, data integrity,
destructive operations, and complex state synchronization.

The implementer may execute an approved plan in these areas but must escalate
missing, contradictory, or unsafe decisions instead of improvising.

## Cost and context discipline

- Reuse established context and repository planning artifacts.
- Pass concise but complete handoffs.
- Do not ask workers to rediscover architecture unnecessarily.
- Do not duplicate tasks or use parallel write-heavy agents.
- Keep reports limited to changes, validation, blockers, deviations, and
  material findings.
- Reserve the primary agent's reasoning for investigation, architecture,
  ambiguity, difficult debugging, review, risk analysis, and acceptance.
- Token efficiency never justifies skipping correctness or validation.

## Observability

Whenever work is delegated:

- Use the configured custom agent by its exact name.
- Make delegation visible through normal subagent activity.
- Do not silently perform delegated write-heavy work in the parent.
- Identify which agent performed the work after it returns.
- Inspect the actual diff rather than trusting its summary.
